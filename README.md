# AWS-based-Workforce-task-Assignment-and-Monitoring-system


## Project Description

A cloud-based system designed to streamline workforce management by enabling task assignment, tracking, and monitoring using AWS services. The system leverages AWS’s scalable and secure ecosystem to provide real-time insights into workforce activities without requiring traditional server hosting or backend development.

## Key Features

* Dynamic task assignment to workforce members.
* Real-time task progress monitoring.
* Notifications and alerts using AWS SNS and SQS.
* Secure user authentication and management with AWS Cognito.
* Centralized data storage with AWS RDS and S3.
* Automated logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and Flow Logs.
* Serverless task automation via AWS Lambda.

## AWS Services Used

* **IAM** – Secure access and permissions management.
* **VPC & Flow Logs** – Network isolation and activity monitoring.
* **Cognito** – User authentication and management.
* **RDS** – Relational database for storing tasks and user data.
* **S3** – Storage for task-related files and reports.
